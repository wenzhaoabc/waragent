21. **Population Displacement and Refugee Management**: Not significant in 1939, but millions became refugees after the fall of France in 1940.

Poland = """In the early stages of World War II in 1939, Poland faced significant challenges in its financial situation. It is important to note that obtaining exact figures from this period can be difficult due to the chaotic circumstances and limited data availability. However, here is an overview of the situation:

1. GDP (Gross Domestic Product): In 1938, Poland's GDP was estimated at around $8.2 billion (in 1990 US dollars).

2. Government Revenue:
   - Taxes: The Polish government relied heavily on customs duties, excise taxes, and income taxes, but specific figures are not readily available.
   - Issuance of National Debt: As the war began, Poland started issuing war bonds to finance its defense, but the exact amount raised is uncertain.
   - Foreign Aid and Loans: Limited international aid was received, mainly from France and the United Kingdom.

3. Military Expenditure: Prior to the invasion, military spending increased, but precise numbers are difficult to determine. However, it is estimated that around 10% of the GDP was allocated to defense.

4. Social Welfare and Reconstruction Spending:
   - Social Welfare: Limited resources were allocated to welfare programs, with a focus on military preparations.
   - Post-War Reconstruction: Not applicable in the early stages since the war had just begun.

5. National and External Debt Levels: Poland had some debt before the war, but detailed figures are not easily accessible.

6. Inflation Rate and Money Supply: Inflation was relatively low before the war, but it would escalate due to war-related pressures.

7. Foreign Exchange Reserves and Exchange Rates: Poland had some reserves, but they were quickly depleted during the German invasion.

8. International Trade:
   - Export and Import Volumes: Poland was an agricultural and industrial exporter, but the war disrupted these flows.
   - Strategic Imports: Poland imported oil and raw materials, which became scarce during the conflict.

9. Gold Reserves: Poland held gold reserves, but they were evacuated to the UK for safekeeping as the war progressed.

10. Productivity and Industrial Output: Poland had a growing industrial base, but it was significantly impacted by the war.

11. Human Capital: Poland had a large workforce, but mobilization for the war effort reduced the number of available workers in the civilian sector.

12. Tax Policies and Structures: The tax system was adjusted to increase revenues for the war, but details are scarce.

13. War Reparations and Compensation: Not applicable in the early stages, as Poland was the victim rather than the aggressor.

14. Resource Self-Sufficiency Rate: Poland was somewhat self-sufficient, but still relied on imports for certain key resources.

15. Agricultural Output: Agriculture remained a significant part of the economy, though production was affected by the war.

16. Informal Economy and Black Market Activities: These grew in importance as official channels became disrupted.

17. International Cooperation and Assistance: Limited assistance came from France and the UK, primarily military support.

18. War Bonds and Civilian Financing: Poles purchased war bonds to support their country, but the total amount is unknown.

19. Infrastructure Damage and Rehabilitation: Early in the war, damage was limited, but it would escalate as the conflict continued.

20. Technology Innovation and Military R&D Investment: Poland invested in military technology, but it was no match for Germany's advanced weaponry.

21. Population Displacement and Refugee Management: In the early stages, there was minimal displacement, but millions would become refugees later in the war.

22. Wartime Economic Controls: The government implemented price controls and rationing as the war progressed.

Remember, these estimations are based on historical context and may not reflect precise figures due to the limitations of available data from that time."""
